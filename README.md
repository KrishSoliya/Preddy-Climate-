Climate Prediction
Overview
This repository contains a project focused on climate prediction using various statistical and machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze historical climate data and create models to predict future climate trends and changes. This project can help in understanding the potential impacts of climate change and aid in making informed decisions for environmental planning and policy-making.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess historical climate data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and analyze data to uncover patterns and trends.
Modeling: Implement various predictive models including linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
Forecasting: Generate future climate predictions based on the best-performing models.
